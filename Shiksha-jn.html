      <p>
        Role: Brand/Web Designer + Developer <br />
        Designed & Developed the website.

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Shiksha means education, learning and teaching in Hindi. And Jn. is
        short form for junction. Shiksha Jn. helps Engineering/Pharmacy students
        and professionals achieve a comprehensive skill set as per real-time
        industry needs and enhance their technical & professional skills.
        <br /><br />
        They offer LIVE sessions taught by industry professionals on various
        engineering & pharmacy topics. Users can check out the course details
        and enroll directly on the website.

      <h2>The problem</h2>
      <p>
        The old website was developed by a freelance developer and lacked design
        thinking. Students and Professors were struggling to navigate and find
        details about the courses.
        <br /><br />
        Bad design was also hurting the trust of new visitors. They wanted
        something more mature. After all these students were not kids and the
        courses were also quite advanced.
        <br /><br />
        The founder/client contacted me to discuss these problems. And after few
        long zoom meetings, we both came to the conclusion that we absolutely
        need to redesign this website. And a brand refresh too, More on that
        later.
      </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Design constraints</h2>
      <p>
        The Client had a limited budget and changes have to made relatively
        quickly to keep students and professors trust in the platform. They also
        needed the functionality to add/edit courses themself, And a lot more
        features.
      </p>
      <p>
        So we decided to use WordPress to build this website, for two basic
        reasons.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>More backed control(simple dashboard for the founder)</li>
        <li>Functional and customizable(compared to other builders)</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>The solution</h2>
      <p>
        I started by learning about the business and the competitive landscape
        and why would users will use this platform in the first place. My
        previous experience working full time in ed-tech helped a lot. I found
        out that e-learning platforms lacked character and emotions. They were
        pretty boring and complex.
        <br /><br />
        The client was constantly in touch with users and asking questions on
        what they want to see in the new website. In my secondary research I
        found that our competitors have most of the important course info behind
        a pay wall and pricing was also deceptive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the few design solutions I derived from my primary and
        secondary research.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Convey emotions and joyful tone of voice.</li>
        <li>Provide course details upfront and in depth.</li>
        <li>Be 100% transparent about pricing.</li>
        <li>Keep the enrollment process simple and seamless.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>User interviews</h2>
      <p>
        I already had a lot of ideas and biases on what users want from my
        previous ed-tech experience. But I wanted to learn what users actually
        want.
        <br />We found the right user group for interview by answering following
        questions
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who are the end users?</li>
        <li>What do they want?</li>
        <li>Why will they use our platform?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        End Users: Engineering Students from 3rd tier colleges and universities.
        What they want/need: They want to learn realtime skills that will help
        them land their first job. Why they will choose our platform/courses: We
        will provide a mature yet friendly platform and faculty they can trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        We started talking to students from 3rd tier universities who are about
        to graduate.
        <br />Some of the key questions we asked:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>What are your worries about your career?</li>
        <li>What do you prefer, online or offline classes?</li>
        <li>What do you want in the course?</li>
        <li>What should be included on our website?</li>
        <li>What should be the enrollment process?</li>
        <li>What fees sound reasonable/affordable to you?</li>
      </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Design process</h2>
      <p>
        Since the client wanted a functionality to add/edit courses feature, I
        created a global template that will stay consistent across all courses
        except the dynamic content(chapters, product image, etc.)
        <br /><br />
        I designed these pages to provide all the details upfront in a friendly
        way. Below enroll button I included a inquiry link to help users easily
        questions before buying the course. All the course/product image were
        designed by me. I chose the book style because it looked good and also
        differentiated our courses from the competition.

      <h3 class="h3gap">Before</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>No visual appeal.</li>
        <li>Not enough information.</li>
        <li>Generic features and benefits.</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="/img/sjn/sjn-dp-before.webp" alt="" />
      <h3 class="h3gap">After</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Visually appealing.</li>
        <li>Course details upfront.</li>
        <li>Generic features and benefits.</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="/img/sjn/sjn-dp-after.webp" alt="" />
      <img src="/img/sjn/sjn-dp-after2.webp" alt="" />
      <h3 class="h3gap">Hassle free checkout</h3>
      <p>
        In my research users often sound frustrated by the login prompt while
        checkout. So I kept the checkout experience clean, simple and easy. No
        need to sign up or login, just fill your details and checkout.
      </p>
      <img src="img/sjn/sjn-checkout.webp" alt="" />
      <h3 class="h3gap">User delight!</h3>
      <p>
        The payment successful message in Woocommerce(A popular WordPress
        plugin) doesnâ€™t include user name. It just shows the order details. So I
        did some research and added php code to include user name with a
        congratulations message. It added more delight for the user.
      </p>
      <img src="img/sjn/sjn-success-message.webp" alt="" />
      <h3 class="h3gap">Landing Page</h3>
      <p>
        The previous design was generic and lacked emotions, I fixed that by
        bringing in right image, copy & layout.
      </p>

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <p>
        To build the users trust in the platform we also needed a strong and
        consistent brand behind the platform. Branding also helped us
        differentiate from the competition. Furthermore the brand guide I
        developed for the client also helped me in the design process of the
        website(Type, colors, design system etc).

          <h3>Defining the brand</h3>
          <p>
            Shiksha Jn. is a platform where people come to build a better
            tomorrow.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Brand purpose</h3>
          <p>To enhance the skill sets & employability of Indian youths.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Brand attributes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Genuine</li>
            <li>Friendly</li>
            <li>Inspiring</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3 class="h3gap">The Logo</h3>
      <p>
        The logomark gives a feeling of modern, sharp and fast moving
        representing the nature of the brand. The mark was made from a perfect
        square with three rounded and one sharp corner which gives a feeling of
        reliable and sharp at the same time. <br />
        A Junction is a place at which two or more rail routes converge or
        diverge.

      <h3 class="h3gap">Colors & Type</h3>
      <p>
        Finding the right colors & fonts included research, brand archetypes,
        and peers feedback.

      <img src="/img/sjn/sjn-type.svg" alt="" />
      <h3 class="h3gap">Icons & Illustrations</h3>
      <p>
        I used Fontawesome for icons and designed the illustrations that
        complement the brand image.
      </p>
      <img src="/img/sjn/sjn-icons.webp" alt="" />

      <h3 class="h3gap">Design system & brand guide</h3>
      <p>
        I created a global design system on WordPress, so that the client can
        easily manage the website. I created a brand guide as well so that the
        graphic designers and employees can refer to it to develop further brand
        collaterals.

    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        Students and professors love the new design, the client also gained
        confidence in promoting the brand, and getting positive feedback all
        around. But, we are not done yet. Students also use the Shiksha Jn.
        mobile app to manage recordings and other tasks. I hope I get to work on
        the App design as well to further enhance the UX.
