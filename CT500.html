      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        CT500 is a weather app that displays the current temperature and time of
        major cities around the world. The App displays a few major cities by
        default, but users can add or remove cities as well.
      </p>

      <h2>Use cases</h2>
      <p>
        CT500 can be used in a couple of ways. From learning about major cities
        to planning a trip.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A user can browse through the list of cities and familiarize themself
          with major cities around the world. They can see the current time and
          temperature to comprehend how diverse our world actually is.
        </li>
        <li>
          A user can add a few favorite cities to the page and see what’s the
          temperature in all those cities in one place. Without having to google
          it everytime.
        </li>
        <li>
          A user can add cities that they are planning a vacation or trip to. By
          regularly tracking their temperatures they can decide which city they
          should visit.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        I wanted to create a simple and easy experience for users. So the App
        has one font and gray color scheme. I chose minimal design because there
        is a lot of dynamic info in the design, and users should be able to
        navigate easily.
      </p>
      <img src="/img/CT500/colors and type.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        I kept the autocomplete feature on the input so that users can see which
        cities are present in the list and they can just select it. I also
        didn’t want to frustrate the users with alert and error popups if they
        did some action on the page. So I kept everything visible but easy on
        the eye and non distracting. I added a reset button in case the user
        wanted to just see the default few major cities and added/deleted some
        cities for fun. Finally I put each city on individual cards, so the
        information is nicely organized. The City Name and temperature are in
        the biggest font and higher contrast for Hierarchy. The cross or remove
        button is clearly visible and interactive on hover. So that users can
        easily understand it but it’s not distracting.

      <h2>User Testing</h2>
      <p>
        I tested this app with 5 users. Each time I just opened the App and
        observed their actions and reactions. Surprisingly they all started by
        adding a city to the list, then they all performed various tasks. But
        none of them had any problems navigating and using the app. Users find
        the design clean and easy to use. So for now I am keeping the design as
        it is.
      </p>

      <h2>Code</h2>
      <p>
        I used vanilla JavaScript to build this App. Stack overflow and ChatGPT
        helped a lot. For Autocomplete a find a github repo. That helped me
        build this feature.
        <br /><br />
        This was my first JavaScript project, so I learned a lot of JavaScript
        concepts while building this app.I started with creating some arrays for
        cities, countries and timezones on python. I got the data from Natural
        Earth Data, and then passed that to a python script. Selecting cities
        was a real pain. Because I didn’t want to miss any major cities. After
        some thinking, I decided to filter the cities by their area and
        population.
      </p>

      <p>
        To fetch the real time weather I am using OpenWeatherAPI. and local
        storage to save the user generated cities.
        <br /><br />
        The responsive card layout is achieved in CSS using flexbox. I added
        some hover and active state in the design to keep the App visually
        interactive.
