          We've come a long way since our early days as a publicly traded
          company on the New York Stock Exchange. The Sabre era brought its own
          set of challenges, and we even ventured into the world of paper
          companies, but through it all, we've remained dedicated to providing
          quality paper and endless amusement. Under the leadership of David
          Wallace, we've continued to grow and adapt to the ever-changing paper
          industry.
